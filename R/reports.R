#' List reports found in report directory
#'
#' Makes a list of raw report files in `report_dirs`.
#' This function descends the directories rooted at `report_dirs` to find all reports to be run.
#' Reports to be run are identified by filename extensions,
#' by default `c(".Rmd", ".Rnw")`.
#'
#' Users can override the default value of `report_dirs` to supply their own
#' report directory(ies).
#' If users want to also include the default reports,
#' be sure to include `system.file(file.path("reports"), package = "SEAPSUTWorkflow")`
#' in the vector of paths supplied to `report_dirs`.
#'
#' @param report_dirs A string that identifies a directory of reports to be generated.
#'                    Default is `system.file(file.path("reports"), package = "SEAPSUTWorkflow")`,
#'                    which provides some default reports.
#' @param report_suffixes A vector of strings of report suffixes. Default is `c(".Rmd", ".Rnw")`.
#'
#' @return A vector of absolute paths to reports to be generated.

#' Generate reports found in report directory
#'
#' This function descends the directory rooted at `report_dir` and executes `knitr::knit()` on all
#' files with `report_suffixes`.
#'
#' Each report name is suffixed by date and time.
#' Previous reports are shuffled to a folder named `<<report_name>>_prev`.
#'
#' @param report_source_files A vector of absolute paths to reports that need to be run,
#'                            probably generated by `report_source_paths()`.
#' @param report_dest_folder A string that identifies the directory into which the completed reports should be written.
#'                           Default is `drake::readd(SEAPSUTWorkflow::target_names[["report_dest_folder"]]`
#'
#' @return A boolean. `TRUE` for success, `FALSE` if an error occurred.
